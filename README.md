# Calculus Calculator
This is my personal favorite ongoing project, a program that uses known differential rules to evaluate polynomial expressions and return their derivatives and/or integrals.
So far, it has 4 functions
"findTerms" works with the simplest of polynomials to extract the individual terms.
"analyzeTerms" further extracts the necessary data
"powerRuleDerivative" applies the well-known power rule of differential calculus
"chainRuleDerivative" applies the Chain Rule to basic functions requiring further extraction
